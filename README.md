# My dotfiles, organized with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)
## Get all the dotfiles:
- `pip3 install dotbot`
- `git clone github.com/thor314/dotfiles.git && cd .dotfiles && dotbot -c install.conf.yaml`

# notes
## What about files in my root directory?
`dotbot` can't update symlinks in my root directory unless run with sudo. So be careful about that.
