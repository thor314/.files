""" Thor's Obsidian vimrc
" generally refer to: https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-vimrc-support
" To test file, write file and run "reload app without saving"
" 
" To use an Obsidian command (see back, forward example):
" - Use Ctrl+Shift+I to open the dev console
" - reload and type :obcommand. The names are now in the Console (2nd tab).
" - note, can't rebind exmap-obmap commands with map
" Also execute codemirror commands with cmcommand, js with jscommand.
"
" Note about `surround`: as of 2022-05-20, surround does not work, and is janky
" anyhow, but there's a fix coming, eventually, maybe.
